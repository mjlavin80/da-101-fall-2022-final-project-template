# DA 101 Final Project Assignment

## Topic Exploration Assignment

## Fall 2022

## Overall Assignment Description

The purpose of the final project is to combine the core skills you have gained in the class in an application of the data cycle producing a short polished report on a question of your choosing, ideally something that you're passionate about or is relevant to your life or interests (some suggestions are offered toward the end). The final project is divided into four components, each due during a different quarter of the semester. Each assignment is worth 25% of the assignment grade, and the final project as a whole is worth 30% of your grade for the course.

This final project will incorporate all of the steps involved in the data cycle depicted to the right. You will be in charge of stating an interesting question that doesnâ€™t duplicate previous projects/labs, conducting exploratory analyses using skills from the entire semester, building a model that you will interpret, then communicating your key findings in a polished, professional narrative. 

Remember that the data cycle is an iterative, not linear, process. You may find that your original question must be revised to match the available data or that your data will need restructuring to match the question effectively. Further, your first prediction/explanation model might not be your final model. Consider revising the model to solidify your ability to interpret a clear finding. 

Your project must analyze a real-world data set, using the course concepts and materials. You should choose a topic and data set that interests you, and come up with a main question and hypothesis that is answerable. The goal of the project includes demonstrating the breadth of techniques we learned as part of the data analytics cycle this semester: from data cleaning, visualization, summary stats, hypothesis testing, regression, and interpretation. 

Lastly, the final project will be an opportunity to practice your communication with non-technical collaborators / audience, which is a core concern in data analytics generally, as well as Denison's data analytics major. 

Consistent work and progress on your final projects, once the topic is chosen, will ensure a strong end to the semester. Lab time in our final weeks will be set aside for "project sprints," but it is your responsibility to make use of this time. You will still need to work on the project outside of class time to complete it to a high standard. You will receive feedback from your instructor at each of the final project stages.

__Note:__ Do not include raw computer output in your writing: Readability is a major component of reports, so use headings, tables, figure captions, etc. to make it easy to follow.

## Part I: Topic Exploration Component 

In this component, you will fill out and submit a brief questionnaire fleshing out the initial details of your final project, such as your overall topic, your research question (what you're curious about), and what methods you might use to address your research question. You will also address how you might answer your research question by dividing your question into a set of smaller, more manageable questions, and by naming a publicly available data set that you will use to address your research question. The data sets available include those that you are already familiar with and several more, and they represent the key areas in which you may choose to focus when doing a Data Analytics major: 

- Anthropology and Sociology
- Biology
- Economics/Business
- Physics
- Political Science
- Psychology
- Philosophy
- Sports Analytics
- Humanities (e.g., history, literature, linguistics)
- Design your own domain area!

### On Choosing a Research Question

For this assignment, you can ask questions that are closed (yes or no answer; are the two things different or not?) or open (require more thought and explanation; how much does something change? How is it related to something else?). Likewise, our data analyses can serve one or more purposes as we move through the data analysis cycle: descriptive (describes different measures of the data), exploratory (looking for patterns or unknown relationships in the data); inferential (using a sample to tell us something about a larger population); predictive (use relationships in the current/past data to predict the future); or causal (what happens to one variable when one or more other variables change?). Mostly, choose something that you are curious about and will allow you demonstrate the listed concepts for the project. Have some fun with it!

### Worksheet Questions 

Copy these questions to a new document. (RMD, MD, Word doc formats are all acceptable.) Write your responses and save your file. Each response should be 3-5 sentences. Make sure your file name includes your last name. (For example, I would call mine "lavin-topic-exploration.md".) When finished, upload your submission to Canvas by clicking on Assignments > Topic Exploration Scaffolding > Upload.

1. What broad topic area are you interested in (for example, biology, politics, sports analytics), and how can you narrow that focus to a more specific subtopic (for example, invasive species, polarization, predicting MVPs in the NBA)? 

2. What kinds of questions are you interested in asking? Using the guidance in the section of this assignment called "On Choosing a Research Question", describe three possible research questions below. 

3. How divide your question into a set of smaller, more manageable questions? For example, a research question related to predicting MVPs in the NBA might include (1) what statistics seem to be the most important when evaluating MVPs; (2) which players seem to have the strongest scores in these areas? (3) How  can we combine or weight these different scores to arrive at one summary statistic per player? (4) Under such a model, who are the top ten MVP candidates for 2022-23 so far? Divide your research question like this and write out four smaller, more manageable questions below.

4. What methods from DA 101 might you use to address your research question? Options include exploratory visuals, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, t-tests, and linear regression.

5. Using the resources listed in the section called "Where Can I Find Data Sets?", do some exploring. Look for a publicly available data set that fits your research question in some way. It's okay to modify your research question or topic slightly to match a data set. Below, provide a link to the three most promising data sets you find. It's also okay if you already know which of the three you want to use. 

6. Choose one of your data sets from number five. Look at the different files in your data set and/or the different columns in your main CSV. Identify and list out the following: 

- One column/variable that you can use as a continuous/discrete dependent variable 
- At least one column/variable with continuous/discrete data that you could use as an independent variable (for, say, correlation or linear regression)
- At least one column/variable with nominal/ordinal data that you could use as an independent variable (for, say, multiple regression or a t-test)
