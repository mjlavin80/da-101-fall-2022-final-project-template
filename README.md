# DA 101 Final Project Assignment

## Spring 2021

## Assignment Description

The purpose of the final project is to combine the core skills you have gained in the class in an application of the data cycle producing a short polished report on a question of your choosing, ideally something that you're passionate about or is relevant to your life or interests (some suggestions are offered toward the end). The final project is divided into four components, each due during a different quarter of the semester. Each assignment is worth 25% of the assignment grade, and the final project as a whole is worth 30% of your grade for the course.

This final project will incorporate all of the steps involved in the data cycle depicted to the right. You will be in charge of stating an interesting question that doesn't duplicate previous projects/labs, conducting exploratory analyses using skills from the entire semester, building a model that you will interpret, then communicating your key findings in a polished, professional narrative. 

Remember that the data cycle is an iterative, not linear, process. You may find that your original question must be revised to match the available data or that your data will need restructuring to match the question effectively. Further, your first prediction/explanation model might not be your final model. Consider revising the model to solidify your ability to interpret a clear finding. 

Your project must analyze a real-world data set, using the course concepts and materials. You should choose a topic and data set that interests you, and come up with a main question and hypothesis that is answerable. The goal of the project includes demonstrating the breadth of techniques we learned as part of the data analytics cycle this semester: from data cleaning, visualization, summary stats, hypothesis testing, regression, and interpretation. 

Lastly, the final project will be an opportunity to practice your communication with non-technical collaborators / audience, which is a core concern in data analytics generally, as well as Denison's data analytics major. 

Consistent work and progress on your final projects, once the topic is chosen, will ensure a strong end to the semester. Lab time in our final weeks will be set aside for "project sprints," but it is your responsibility to make use of this time. You will still need to work on the project outside of class time to complete it to a high standard. You will receive feedback from your instructor at each of the final project stages.

__Note:__ Do not include raw computer output in your writing: Readability is a major component of reports, so use headings, tables, figure captions, etc. to make it easy to follow.

## Part IV: Written Analysis and Reflection

### Written Analysis 

This final submission will be a polished rMarkdown file and its knitted HTML output. It should report the results of your final data analysis project. Roughly, it will be 3-4 written pages (5 maximum). The written reflection (described below) can be a part of this document.) Consider the assignment a "final takeaway" of all the skills you've learned in class over the semester. Below is a rough structure of your final written report. Here you should use code folding so this section mirrors a ready to deliver report with clear section headers and interpretations of any statistical or graphical output (like several of our previous projects), but it will also be easy for your instructor to see the code, if needed. Include the following sections in your report:

__Introduction__: 

Provide a two paragraph introduction, professionally written, that gives an overview of the essentials someone needs to know to make sense of the data you show. You must cite and link to your data set somewhere in the introduction (a footnote is OK). Revising and building on your introduction from the previous assignments is allowed and encouraged, but using the exact same introduction is discouraged.

__Ethical Considerations__: 

Provide one paragraph discussing the stakeholders in your data analysis and your ethical concerns or responsibilities using the data and in your analysis. Everyone has ethical considerations, no matter what the data set or subject matter.

__Data Explanation and Exploration__: 

Provide some details describing the data you are working with. What are the observations? The key variables you will be looking at? Are there any particular challenges in the data you will need to work through or be aware of during analysis? 

Provide two polished visuals that describes the data in a way relevant to your question (descriptive, not related to your statistical model specifically--not a scatter plot). Write text that describes the data and what the visuals tell you about your data or decisions you will need to make for the analysis.

__Statistical Analysis and Interpretation__: 

Provide at least two distinct statistical models (for example; multivariate regression and/or t-test) that you interpret correctly and fully in the text. Report your results in a polished table (kable).

Provide at least three polished visuals that specifically support and validate the model(s) you have developed (e.g., residual and regression line/scatter, histogram showing normality of data or residuals, etc.), or help to communicate your main result. Visuals should have captions and be referred to clearly in your text, and they should not all be the same (e.g., not three scatter plots).
Text should fully explain what you show and your findings, to someone who is unfamiliar with your data, code, and models, in terms of the data and in plain language.

__Conclusions__: 

Provide one or two paragraphs concluding about the data: what does it tell us, what are the limitations to this data/model, and what is one future direction you could envision for future data analysts or data collectors?

Find at least one reference that is relevant to or supports your insights, and cite it in this section. You may cite a reference by linking directly to it in your Rmd and/or citing it using your style of choice. Either way, the full citation should also appear in a "Works Cited" page below the conclusions section. 

### Project Reflections

This should be a brief (3-4 paragraphs) look back on the work you have done for this assignment. 

- What "rules" did you follow for working with and interpreting the data and statistics?
- What do you think was your most effective data visualization? 

### What to Turn in, and How to Submit


To submit this assignment, you will check out the DA 101 Spring 2021 Final Project Template from Github Classroom by visiting the following link: https://classroom.github.com/a/fTg7DvWm

Don't forget to make your own branch and set it as the default branch!

The repository includes a blank RMD file, and several sub-folders that you can use to store data, documentation, etc. Your completed submission should include your completed RMD file, your knitted HTML, all data files used in the project, and any other supplementary files you think would be useful (such as documentation, metadata files for your data sets, etc.). 

Don't forget to make a pull request when you are done!
